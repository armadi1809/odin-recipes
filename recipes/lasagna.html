    <h1>Italian Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/lasagna.jpeg" alt="lasagna Picture" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very
      wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of
      stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as rag√π,
      vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
      <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
      <li>
        1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)
      </li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a
        combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three
        kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.
        We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix
        of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
      </li>
      <li>
        From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of
        noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you
        have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
